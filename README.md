# Predicting loan repayment using Machine Learning classification models

For this project, I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

This project will be using the lending data from 2007-2010 and will be trying to classify and predictnig whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

Languages: Python Packages: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn Machine Learning Classifiers used in this project: Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradientboosting
